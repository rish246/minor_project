		<document><![CDATA[@stevebiddle @zkarj @nzfatmatt @Rosspnz @scottjpalmer to be fair, a PA18 can reach that speed! More stylish than a B737 also :-)]]></document>

		<document><![CDATA[@agentK so what link do you use to sign up?]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@agentK I might sign up on the plane in a few months, pretty sure I have seen a form somewhere. Yeah, I know, but still.]]></document>

		<document><![CDATA[@AndreasMNZ still the reviews on Tripitaka are good, so I will take a look. Thanks!]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@AndreasMNZ in theory I can do the same with Checkmytrip. What I really want is to enter ref number and have it auto populate]]></document>

		<document><![CDATA[@stevebiddle @agentK @dingfelder I dunno. Misleading with all the small text under the large headlines... But yeah, maybe it's "acceptable".]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@graysonottaway @stevebiddle well Jetstar is equivalent to Easyjet... So all we need is a market of 50 million more people :-P]]></document>

		<document><![CDATA[@Rosspnz @TradeMe I disagree. Must be for a house in Wellington. That's not a big enough deposit for Auckland!]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@stevebiddle they should insist that you can't fly without a gun in your checked baggage. That will fix it. Grrrrrrr]]></document>

		<document><![CDATA[@agentK yeah, weird. J back from Marita is easy enough, but even A320 to Cain's then B787 to Marita has no J. Weird. Look at 11 &amp; 27 July.]]></document>
