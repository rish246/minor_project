		<document><![CDATA[Plus I have to imagine those guys gossip a lot amongst themselves because who else are they gonna vent/talk to]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[Purely from an access/fly on the wall standpoint, because they're the guys you don't think twice about]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[yaknow thinking about it, if that POTUS Staff Twitter account were legit Secret Service agents would actually be plausible people behind it]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[(At that point, western and central Canadian conservatives had common ground to want it dead for different reasons)]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[(the long gun registry didn't get SUPER controversial in Canada until it came out how much money was being spent on it)]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[Oh, and the gun registry money pit was ALSO going on at the time. Which is the real reason there was political capital to kill it]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[Granted the 90s were also a great time for the economy and Paul Martin was finance minister but it's still fascinating]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[And what still gets me is that even though Adscam happened on Chretien's watch, his govt STILL posted surpluses]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[But yeah; while the US Republicans have been all about a specific agenda the last several decades the Liberals are all about cribbing ideas]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[And what sunk the LIberals last time was the CPC unifying and the time-delayed cyanide capsule Chretien left for Paul Martin's govt]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[HOWEVER unlike the US Republicans they're anything but ideologically "pure" because the key to their success is a big tent strategy]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[Conversely the federal Liberals are sorta like the Republicans in the US in that there's a "we're the rightful ruling party" mindset to them]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[Several of those realists have now left federal politics, which makes one wonder.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[The whole reason the CPC exists even was more a case of them having enough realists in the room who went "we need to unify to beat the Libs"]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[And ultimately both groups have different sets of priorities based on geography]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[You've got the more ideological western Conservatives, and the more centrist Red Tories who aren't that far off from the Liberals really]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[We haven't had a monolithic Conservative ideology in Canada since the Reform party split off; even under Harper there were factions]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[I'm not a Stephen Harper fan but I can still appreciate how hard his job was to keep the various Conservative factions under one tent.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[I'm kinda wondering how O'Leary would do as well given he kinda has to keep the CPC united for two years. And that's not an easy task]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@Suribot What is that from?]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[O'Leary is popular in the leadership race for kinda those same reasons.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[A valid criticism of Trudeau is that he was kinda a celebrity candidate/frontman rather than a career politician]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[What I REALLY find puzzling re: the whole Kevin O'Leary candidacy for Conservative leadership is it undercuts some anti-Trudeau arguments]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[Curious if they'll make it an Arrow or Supergirl universe show now if so]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[Back in October, I had a parody idea I figured would be pointless once the election ended.
But after the last two weeks it's still viable]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[Someone leak the original "Powerless" pilot online because I want to see how what could have been measures up to what we got]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@DeadPigmon And the original trailer from last year is a COMPLETELY different product from what we ended up getting. Which is disappointing]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@DeadPigmon Huh; I saw more positive stuff for the original pilot online. The current pilot is not good at all]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[Also, I'm just realizing that Kate Mucucci is nowhere to be found in the final show and WHAT THE HELL because she is entertaining]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[There's footage reused from the original trailer but WOW the tone is completely different from the original promo we got last year]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[And ah; this explains a lot; the original showrunner left. So the stuff they teased with last year is all from the ditched pilot]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[Also, I'm left wondering because half the promo footage that's out there wasn't in this episode even but in presumably a later one]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[It deserves another episode or two on the strength of the CONCEPT alone, despite the botched execution, but it'll need to impress me]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[I really want to see the original non-retooled pilot now because everyone was speaking pretty highly of that and this feels off the mark]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[Ultimately the tone the promo clips were going for is NOT the tone of the pilot and they kinda need to course correct this]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[But yeah; it's going for a more comedic tone with a dramatic score. And not an ironically used dramatic score, but one played straight]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[That's unsurprising mind given Tudyk's a talented and reliable performer who can bring whatever a show needs him to bring]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[Show takes itself too seriously when it should be having fun. Alan Tudyk's the best part of it because he gets the proper tone to go for]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[I think part of the problem though is that I was expecting something more akin to Better Off Ted and this show is nothing like that]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[Ironically it feels like it's a silly comedy idea being infected by the Serious elements of DC TV/film productions]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[The concept of the show has potential and the actors aren't bad but the tone they edited this thing for doesn't really work]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[Like, this is supposed to be a comedy but the score, for instance, doesn't actually fit the tone]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[Yeah; I think Powerless doesn't know what tone it's going for]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@DeadPigmon @Suribot Oh, Phylla Vell. So much of a screwup that writers promptly forgot you exist after you died. (Unfortunately.)]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[Hmmmm. Halfway through ep 1 of Powerless and this is basically "the episode that didn't actually need to be made as it's the setup one"]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[https://t.co/PsTDGJIUXX *waits for Hasbro to cue the dump truck full of money again*]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[(The dub at a kid friendly time, the sub at a later time with a liquor license taken advantage of)]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[And even cooler, that theatre used it to announce they're gonna be doing monthly Studio Ghibli screenings, of both dub and subbed versions]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[Saw Princess Mononoke in theatres tonight in celebration of its 20th. Was the SECOND screening, to a packed house]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@el_Ramses What I will say thankfully though is that he's written like Death's Head still and that would be EASY for people to get wrong]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@el_Ramses It's even more boring in the Nova comic https://t.co/2MUn8YuleQ]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@el_Ramses I don't mean the DHII design. I mean this https://t.co/fKr41ARMFR Tho at least Land gave him eyebrows; the guy on Nova doesn't.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@el_Ramses At least he's still being written properly, which is some consolation. But then that's because only people who care use him.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@el_Ramses But noooo we've gotta use the Greg Land redesign lousy as it is]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@el_Ramses He's been used as recently as a few years ago too which is what bugs me. He was in a Spider-Man teamup book and that one-shot]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@el_Ramses But yeah even in Marvel nowadays he's big. But with a crappy redesigned head that's less expressive and more robotic]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@el_Ramses He's a big dude. Even after the 7th Doctor shrunk him down.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@el_Ramses Now what I'd LOVE is for them to do a proper Death's Head but a) he won't be in a wave w/ DHII b) he'd be the crap modern design]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@el_Ramses Well if they did Ego he'd be Kurt Russell Ego, right? So that doesn't quite follow]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@el_Ramses I want to know who the BAF is for GOTG wave 2 myself; I wonder if it's someone who's embargoed]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@el_Ramses That'd make sense but I'm guessing they won't do one given half of them are Netflix characters]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@Qlippot Though MAN is it amusing how the owner of the Vancouver Trump Tower kinda wants out of the naming but he's stuck legally]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[https://t.co/IeSliHaAwY I sorta want the Bullseye to be Colin Farrell because of how wild that'd be]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[Ares sure is an odd choice though considering that he's what - a D-lister in Marvel? If it were DC I'd understand, but Marvel?]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[Kinda curious if that Marvel Knights Blade will be Wesley Snipes, or more comics-based]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@Qlippot I hate that I have to take that seriously just in case]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@JesseWittenrich *looks at the assortments* wait ANOTHER Enchantress? So soon? WTF and dammit Skurge is a BAF?]]></document>

		<document><![CDATA[@Vangelus @TheSilentG Well wasn’t it less a statement, more an answer to a question in an interview that went viral?]]></document>
