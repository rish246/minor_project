		<document><![CDATA[@SkyHelpTeam I saw that. Glad an agreement has been reached.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@kevebbs definitely. I lost my mind when I saw the cask type. Still pretty strong mind you. Definitely knock you out if you have too many]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@bvanmelkebeke good job I wear things like that once in a blue moon. Usually prefer my feet flat]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@kevebbs good choice. Forgot to try the 73 I think. The Grain is such an ever changing dram. Loved it!]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@bvanmelkebeke no and probably not the ones to wear on a cold damp day in town walking over cobbles 🙈]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@bvanmelkebeke probably 😂 although I did manage in 4 inch heels yesterday with not too much pain 👍🏻]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@ocdwhisky @Bunnahabhain indeed it's not. Wouldn't have cried if I had purchased then tried as it would be good for the spring.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[Honestly this place is already amazing value. If you're looking for a midweek treat, can't recommend this highly en… https://t.co/mdwVayqF3S]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@bvanmelkebeke could do it heels I suppose lol 😂😂]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@thisismydram well maybe too early, cause if I do get another plan I'll need to probably drive. Suspect someone is telling me to think again]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[Maybe one to try later on 👍🏻 https://t.co/gPPHyw65mn]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@bvanmelkebeke this is true! Shame I'll not be wearing them as I'll be expected to run about after him all day 😝]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@ocdwhisky @Bunnahabhain some are just like that. For me it's usually a Sherry one that blows my mind and I don't really do the sherry casks]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@ocdwhisky @Bunnahabhain indeed, £62.80 a bottle. Excellent for the price]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@Swaledalebothy with a smws membership you save on the bottles vs non member and you get excellent quality &amp; age at an excellent price.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@Swaledalebothy and you meet really great people and the bottlings are fab. Independent bottlers really do offer great value for money &amp;]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@Swaledalebothy I would say yes. I get a lot out of it and used to enjoy their events for members, however there is less in my local smws]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[Great, he's decided he doesn't feel well so my plans for today are now in tatters. This really sucks 😞]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@ocdwhisky @Bunnahabhain reminded me of sherbet strawberry sweeties. You would probably like it 👍🏻]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@ocdwhisky @Bunnahabhain that I do. I've learnt with whisky to expect the unexpected 👍🏻]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@ocdwhisky @spikeydog120 got to try it to know if you like it or not. Had it served at a coffee tasting once, nobody apart from me ate it]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@spikeydog120 seasoned seaweed is really nice. Some people are like 🤢others really like it.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@ocdwhisky @Bunnahabhain if that's your sort of thing 😂😂 just not what I wanted or expected. Lots of Sherry casks too]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@Andrews_Share @SMWSUK unfortunately not, but that information should be able to be given as all casks can be traced.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@spikeydog120 it's really good. Took it with me for the Bunnahabhain but it wasn't the right dram for it.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@ChrisWhiskyman the whisky. Well not crap I mean it was nice but not what I was looking for]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@Andrews_Share @SMWSUK they do put cask finishes on them but sometimes I do think some have been finished and not advised]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@ChrisWhiskyman 😂😂😂 good job it's crap lol]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@KindaDouglas @Bunnahabhain this one is very unpeated and pretty floral to me. Definitely a perfect lighter dram say for a spring/summer day]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[Cragganmore and spicy seaweed is an amazing combo 👍🏻 https://t.co/Hf1YI8PXtj]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[This is defo a buyer! Amazing long slightly smoked paprika finish. Red wine cragganmore 👍🏻🥃 https://t.co/K6gtgmk7FU]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[New bottle label design but not the full change yet. Hmmmm not sure about this @Bunnahabhain it's not smokey at all… https://t.co/4WybLUXAKA]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[They'd know it was me if I borrowed these 😂😂 https://t.co/YLPCJ2Buy8]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@ocdwhisky @Jotterface I have done in the past 😂😂😂😂👍🏻]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@ocdwhisky @Bunnahabhain I will indeed. Might be another bottle to add to the ever growing collection. Actually might need two!]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@Jotterface @ocdwhisky with lots of cobbles and they are of no use unless I want to get they ruined so I just look at them 😂😂]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@Jotterface @ocdwhisky and good quality shoes last....especially with me as I tend to look at them and then realise I live in a cold place]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@Jotterface @ocdwhisky 😂😂what are you two like? Those shoes could pass for brand new on eBay...I've seen a lot worse being passed off as new]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@ocdwhisky yup! It will be. New @Bunnahabhain which I want to try with my spicy seaweed 😋been carrying it about since Monday]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@ocdwhisky 😂😂😂 I didn't buy them.....technically I did but I didn't cause he gave me the money for them...they are a present 🙈]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@WhiskyApocalyps is the only way. Wonder how many people protesting had American products on their person last night?]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@WhiskyApocalyps it is but looking at it apart from shares there is nothing directly owed by the organisation I know of/use/buy. But boycott]]></document>
