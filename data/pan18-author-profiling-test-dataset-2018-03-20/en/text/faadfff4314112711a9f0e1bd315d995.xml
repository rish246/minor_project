		<document><![CDATA[I assume that's because it would raise too many awkward questions re their manager and crap players...]]></document>

		<document><![CDATA[As Mackay is just toxic and youth development in our country is about to take a major step back.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[I had hoped that Celtic would work closely with a new Performance Director. But it's best to stay distant and do our own thing.]]></document>
