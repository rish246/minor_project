		<document><![CDATA[@AWBiggs regular keepers pads aren't very restrictive, which I presume is why not many have made the shift. Interestingly to see it though]]></document>

		<document><![CDATA[@zealmanNZ @aotearoaxi don't think I've ever heard him express a preference. Can appreciate that he'd want to cement his spot as opener 1st]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@aotearoaxi don't think there's any suggestion he'd be asked to keep and open in tests. + an ODI keeper/opener is pretty much the holy grail]]></document>

		<document><![CDATA[@CricketTragic58 I'd have turned Southee around after the rain break and got wagner up upwind. Don't think that cuts off options does it?]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@Sportsfreakconz agree wagner's than for these conditions - should've been on much earlier for me]]></document>

		<document><![CDATA[@bradmanesque certainly the biggest crowd of the season but I really hope it's not the players' pinnacle #PlunketShield]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@realmshark it does seem like at least one of Worker and Blundell will have to play. Or is my maths wrong?]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@realmshark yeah I'd suggest that means Bruce might be the more likely option behind the stumps tomorrow]]></document>

		<document><![CDATA[That must be just about the most stumpings in an ODI for a @blackcaps? #NZvBAN]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@thelegendaryss2 love that he's kept himself on - must've been tempting to stop after that first wicket]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@CricketTragic58 Southee will be extremely well rested then! Take your point though - he's off the pace right now]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@dougierydal I'm sure he's in the thinking, but probably only as injury cover.  Suspect Munro is probably still ahead of him too]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@dougierydal you reckon he needed a sweetener to play the ODIs? That would be a surprise to me]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@dougierydal this team doesn't make selection decisions like that. Reckon they'll stick with Nicholls for the Bang tests at least]]></document>

		<document><![CDATA[So it feels a bit like he's on a hiding to nothing, which seems a bit rough especially as he's going so well today]]></document>

		<document><![CDATA[@CricketTragic58 it is surprising that he's never really been given a shot at a middle order spot]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[Trying to think if there's anything Neil Broom can do in this series to keep his spot in the XI for the first Chapell-Hadlee game]]></document>
