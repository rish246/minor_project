		<document><![CDATA[@ComicPrintingUK hey, if that's the only problem you have with me, I think we're doing pretty well.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@ComicPrintingUK I HAVE been thinking of stepping into the world of YouTube or podcasting. Or maybe I'll just have a sandwich.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@ComicPrintingUK well then I'd go back to openly weeping and begging.]]></document>

		<document><![CDATA[@ComicPrintingUK maybe he's trying to put off some REALLY bad news.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@ComicPrintingUK ... that wouldn't be catastrophic. Well. It wouldn't be terribly catastrophic. But at that point, just hire an assistant?]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@ComicPrintingUK both good points. Now what I will say is, if you wanted to outsource to someone you've vetted and trained in some way...]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@ComicPrintingUK ah. Yeah. So. No. I mean, we rushed those books last year, but I usually like a lot of communication with a printer.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@ComicPrintingUK I dunno. Do I know them? I know you. I know your standards.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@ComicPrintingUK you COULD outsource. Or. You could finish the accounts and go get a burger.]]></document>

		<document><![CDATA[@UmarDitta @Katiecanartgood that's one hell of an offer.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@codenamewallaby @Katiecanartgood GO! Also bring coffee. For me. Please and thank you.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@Katiecanartgood I'll be there as a punter myself with Kerrie. This year is party year!]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@UmarDitta @Katiecanartgood does your inn provide coffee?]]></document>

		<document><![CDATA[Wish I could thumbs up the PPV but thumbs down the the headline match. https://t.co/NON7KWRwxL]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@johnlees927 that's exactly what @pocketkerrie and I have been saying.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@johnlees927 absolutely. Much better move would have been to have him screw over Strowman and start that feud.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@johnlees927 absolutely. The audience was furious. Then disinterested. Then a few of them close to the front started to leave.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@HugoBoylan I think it's about time the "Reigns as unstoppable babyface" experiment was put to bed. How many live crowds have to die?]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@HugoBoylan the audience genuinely hated Reigns coming down at 30. Upside. That's the biggest pop Randy Orton's got in about 2 years.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[I like Reigns as a performer, but he's gone and turned what is traditionally my favorite WWE PPV, to my least favorite.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[I... I think I might love @BraunStrowman. That was just amazing. #RoyalRumble]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@DavidpbFerguson I agree. Cross and Asuka in a stipulation match (tables?) could be magic. Sanity would look well with the women's belt.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@DavidpbFerguson but she didn't seem to get a consistent advantage.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@DavidpbFerguson interesting. Gotta say I never really considered Cross as a massive threat in that match. She was aggressive, sure...]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@DavidpbFerguson they seem to want to push the Aussies. Wouldn't be surprised to see them take on Cross for a no.1 contender.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@DavidpbFerguson yep. Think DIY and AoP stole the show.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@TheAhmedRaafat you've got that right.]]></document>

		<document><![CDATA[@Treestumped I completely agree. It would be a great step in the right direction.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@Treestumped don't celebrate just yet. There's a little way to go before it's enacted.]]></document>

I'm firmly in the terrorbaby camp.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@DanielFahy you misunderstand me. I like the game and the concept. It just doesn't have the same feeling or gameplay of a traditional ResE.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@DanielFahy the puzzle elements are great, and as a spin-off game I'd be thrilled. It just doesn't feel like the next main titles ResE.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@HugoBoylan it probably sounds like a lot of moaning, but sometimes you just want to dance with who brung ya.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@HugoBoylan I'm really hoping Mass Effect Andromeda is a little closer to the gameplay I'm expecting.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@HugoBoylan KH2.8... eh. I'll give it a proper chance. Just not tonight. I need to be in the right mood to try the new gameplay elements.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@HugoBoylan I'll need to clear a solid weekend for ResEVII, and I will, but I'm no longer in a great rush to do so.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@HugoBoylan while both games seem like a lot of fun, neither are REALLY what I expected from either franchise. That's a little disappointing]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@HugoBoylan KH2.8 is OK. Never played Dream Drop Distance before. Seems like a decent performer. Wish they'd stuck to the KH gameplay.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@HugoBoylan ResEVII is fun. Atmospheric. Will play it to completion at some point. It's not a Resident Evil title. At all. Not even close.]]></document>
