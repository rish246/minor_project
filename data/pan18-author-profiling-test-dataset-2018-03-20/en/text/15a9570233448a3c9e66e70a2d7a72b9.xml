		<document><![CDATA[@JenalaRivera @kreespa @lifeforachild Thank you! 😊]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@WilliamJTV Hahahahaha! Nice! 😉 Gnight, Will. Catch up with you on Sunday! Have a good weekend, lovely! Xx]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@WilliamJTV Right back atcha, my friend! Fingers crossed all works on Sunday &amp; don't forget to say a prayer to the internet gods beforehand!]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@WilliamJTV Lmfao, you could. But that seems like cheating. 😜 😁😁😁]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@WilliamJTV Ha, or I could ask you to catch me up, lol. (If I ever actually catch up myself, lol!)]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@WilliamJTV Hmmm, yeah, from what I gathered it seemed it was kind of geared to a younger audience with the sitcoms and lighthearted shows.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@WilliamJTV Oh, yes! I forgot they all end up online anyway, cheers, babe!]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@WilliamJTV Plus, doesn't help that none of the DC shows are on freetv here, so hard to have to find downloads/streaming etc every week.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@WilliamJTV That said I was never a Flash fan, &amp; Legends was mostly meh for me. Curious about Supergirl though but again, second season now.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@WilliamJTV Yeah, plus the fact I'm too seasons behind on, like, every other DC show doesn't make it too appealing to catch up, y'know?]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@WilliamJTV We get lots of ABC Family shows over here, so maybe that'll come over too. Why the weird name change tho, d'ya know?]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@WilliamJTV Ooooh, I know ABC Family! Used to adore Melissa &amp; Joey (&amp; still like Baby Daddy!) Will keep an eye out for Beyond over here.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@WilliamJTV Hahaha, yeah, I can imagine! But I'll get my laptop set up for 11.40pm, and will just keep one eye on it while finishing Ellie.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@WilliamJTV So I get super confused by the timeline changes thanks to The Flash etc. (Also 3 eps behind TWD too. Shhhhh! *ducks* 😉)]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@WilliamJTV Haha, I will do eventually. I hate the huge amount of crossovers all the time w/Arrow tho coz it's the only DC show I watch.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@WilliamJTV The cast don't seem so cute either, lol.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@WilliamJTV Haha, I've never even heard of that CHANNEL, let alone the show, lol. Will have to imdb it. Yeah, I felt the same re RDale.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@WilliamJTV Obviously, we don't get the ads over here, so I like to watch the US feed for the cool movie spots and fun adverts, lol.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@WilliamJTV Yay! But also boo, coz of the time, lol. Does that include the pre game show? Never watched last year &amp; missd the film trailers.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@WilliamJTV Anyway, I'll stop babbling now. Great to chat to u - let me know about the Superbowl if you're on here before then! Ni night! x]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@WilliamJTV I fell behind w/Arrow, like five eps before the holiday hiatus, never caught up, and haven't even touched The 100 yet!]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@WilliamJTV You'll have to let me know if it's any good, lol. I'm way behind on SO many shows atm, it's ridick. Never heard of Beyond tho.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@WilliamJTV And not seen Riverdale either - not too impressed by the ads. Seems very TVD-ish, but without the cool supernatural element!]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@WilliamJTV Oh good night, my darling! Sorry got distracted. Will you be airing the Superbowl on Sunday? Do you know when it starts?]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@WilliamJTV Yeah, my internet must have had a hissy fit. No harm, it was there when I refreshed!]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@john_kaser @MattLanter @Twitter Bwahaha, I should've known it was President Cheeto's fault. 😉😁]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@MattLanter @Twitter Right?! Thought they'd fixed that! Really enjoying #Timeless btw - the UK just aired the Moon Landing ep yesterday.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@lifeforachild Won £10 on the lottery recently, so perfect opportunity to pay it forward. 😊 Good luck with the campaign!]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@lifeforachild Not to worry, Euros work just as well! Thanks for the link, will definitely do my bit for such a underutilised cause!]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@WilliamJTV Oh, ffs, the feed just died! Was it on my end or yours?]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@WilliamJTV Yeah, it's a colossal pain, lol. But yes, the repeats will definitely help though, thank you! Not a Riverdale fan then, lol?]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@lifeforachild And considering the only Valentines card I'm likely to get is a jokey 1 my parents send from her, it's a fitting cause, lol!😁]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@lifeforachild My darling dog is diabetic &amp; it's such hard work, I can imagine how difficult it must be for ppl in poor countries.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@lifeforachild Oh, wonderful, thank u! I'm in the UK, so Euros would be closest for me, unless there's a British Sterling equivalent?]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@WilliamJTV It'll likely be almost impossible when daylight savings kicks in coz it'd be on at midnight and we'll still be finishing up then]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@WilliamJTV We do Ellie's evening meal &amp; insulin at 11pm, which usually takes an hour or so, so it cuts it a bit too fine w/the timeslot.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@WilliamJTV Glad to hear it, it's been a while! Took my hiatus time out for the holidays. Spn's time is a pain coz of Ellie's food/insulin!]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[Just realised somehow Twitter rudely unfollowed @MattLanter for me. Now too nervous to read his tweets 4 #Timeless spoilers lol! #TimelessUK]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@WilliamJTV Hey stranger, happy belated new year! Hope you're good. Can't get used to the early timeslot for Spn, lol.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[Really loved tonight's #Supernatural. Not normally one for the angel eps, but truly enjoyed it. @aliciawitty was so badass! #redhairdontcare]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@SPN_Sherry @Support Will let you know what I find!]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@SPN_Sherry @Support Oh wow, that really is different! I'll give it a looksee on the laptop after Spn, see what I have. Thanks, hon.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@kreespa @lifeforachild Do you know if anyone in the world can donate to this or is it only for US Citizens?]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@kreespa @lifeforachild Oh wow, I love this so much! Obv, my diabetic loved one has 4 paws &amp; lots of fur, but still a cause close to my 💜!]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@SPN_Sherry @Support That I haven't done. Will give it a go when I'm on my laptop tomorrow. Maybe that's why. What should it look like?]]></document>
