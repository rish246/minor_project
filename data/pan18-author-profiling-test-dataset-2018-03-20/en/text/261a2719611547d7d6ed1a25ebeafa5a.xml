		<document><![CDATA[I can't type tonight]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[Like that better, and I love the stories it all has. I've worn in my Pentax 67 quite a lot over the years. Some beautiful brassing.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[I like buying old cameras in really nice condition, but not to baby them, I wanna be the one that scuffs it, and brasses it, wears it...]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@mark_lj I don't shoot digital, nothing against it, I just prefer this way. Never owned a Nikon before though... haha]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[Seems like it has been used only a handful of times, looks and feels brand new. https://t.co/yV4CYZUETG]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[Half of my 35mm family https://t.co/D8br6dJan5]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@mark_lj I’m actually going to be using theses lenses on the FM2n and the F3HP :)]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@mark_lj problem is when you’re hiking in tighter areas and looking up gets much harder. haha.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@mark_lj probably :) not the biggest, but… big. that’s about a 28mm equivalent (it’s 45mm on 645) https://t.co/O8Gjcbd0Nz]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@roycastro94 which doesn’t matter to me very much at all, AI or AI-S don’t make much difference to me personally for my shooting]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@mark_lj excited to try the 50 1.2, will be very useful]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@roycastro94 I think most AI-S lenses have more aperture blades and coatings, but not 100% for which lenses]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@mark_lj and yeah, I have a 50mm f/1.2 AI-S coming to me later this week :)]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@mark_lj and we go to the mountains a lot, since they’re so close. I think the 35mm will be more suited to people photos, perhaps.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@mark_lj I like 28mm, have one for my AE-1 and my M3 and M6, but I think I need something slightly wider for when I go to the mountains]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[Definitely need a 50mm, 35mm and a 24mm. 

For 24mm I was thinking this lens... https://t.co/thG9ZC970V]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[Generally speaking anyway. Since starting at f2 you move two whole stops to f4, instead of two stops to 5.6]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[Plus I think f2 has advantages, not just light collecting and DOF, but stopped down gets higher contrast/quality at lower stops.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[I guess there aren't too many options, since I think f2 is required, 2.8 is just often too slow.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[Talk to me about Nikon 24mm and 35mm (or even 20mm?) lenses... AI OR AI-S.... nothing newer anyway.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@fujifilmshooter for black and white 4x5 so far I really think it's great - and easy to get great scans]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@fujifilmshooter it still needs careful correcting in Photoshop but nothing difficult or more than simple exposure and contrast]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@fujifilmshooter there's nothing to it really, for black and white anyways. It scans in auto, then I tweak the histogram quickly]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[Anyway, really excited to start the next chapter of my photo life with the FM2n and shortly the F3HP will join.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[Also. I like the rubber hoods in most cases, and that's a big reason why I got this specific listing.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[Got a very nice looking 50mm off eBay, came with front and rear caps as well as the rubber hood. For cheaper with shipping than local...]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[The first lens I want for the FM2n is a 50mm, the one I wanted (I ordered it off eBay) was more expensive locally though.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[And I tell ya, it really is mint...]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[Even came with a motor drive and a zoom lens. Both I'll sell, so that makes it even cheaper in the long run.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[I spent some time looking at local listings for old cameras and ended up saving around $150 on a mint Nikon FM2n. Lucky!]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@mrsaislinL might recognize the location… :) thank you, lots more soon.]]></document>

		<document><![CDATA[@pjdejesus @rpimi If there is a real reason to need longer, like most sports - then yeah it makes sense. Usually a necessity thing]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@rpimi yeah, why not just be honest about it, I like gettting closer. They know, but you get them settled and it's far more intimate shots]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@rpimi yeah I agree, I don't like how it feels when it's a longer lens, feels like spying or stealing a moment, not being in one]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[There are exceptions and it really is personal taste, but when I see portraits with longer lenses I feel like I'm absent from a conversation]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[The problem for me is that lenses longer than 50mm for portraits often feel like you're too far away, not right up beside them for a chat]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@fujifilmshooter nope. Just the free software with the epson. No point (in my opinion), especially for black and white]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@roycastro94 pakon I think I'd like 12x18 or slightly less for prints that will look alright/good. But I don't remember :) been a while]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@roycastro94 yup. V700 can scan quite large. I haven't tried it yet, soon, but I'm sure you would print much larger from v700]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@roycastro94 v700 is great for black and white or larger film in general. I scan all my 4x5 on there. Pakon is pretty nice]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[Hands on, from planning, to shooting, to developing, to scanning. I enjoy it all. A photo shoot isn't just an after… https://t.co/5R9PCslzbx]]></document>

		<document><![CDATA[@DaveMackay17 very cool. Easy to use after a few rounds, even this older one]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[This is what politicians and people putting up walls and denying others leads to... an environment of us vs. then. https://t.co/W3jzzVyyET]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@weston_mcghee excellent. It works well. I've never had a problem before]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@roycastro94 AE-1 is good. But I know a more top end SLR is what I really want. Will get a F3HP soon as well.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@weston_mcghee the MOD54? This is the oldest version, new ones have many upgrades- but still hold 6 :) mine works great]]></document>

		<document><![CDATA[@ArneKuilman it's great hahah one of my favorite pizzas]]></document>

		<document><![CDATA[@RobZeigler I own one of these - the thick neck-pad is really nice https://t.co/LMRz8gd6A3]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@RobZeigler bumpers aren't always needed, but I like them. And the neckpad makes it much nicer to use for long periods]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@ArneKuilman @mpouliot_photo oh yes, I have one too, beer nice little cameras]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@mpouliot_photo yeah that makes sense, I was worried but it's totally fine for me]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@brupsilva the prices seem good, lots around - I really need to try one]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[Still going to get the F3HP though. I can really see these as my ultimate travel and adventure cameras, as well as daily life. Important!]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[I had read a lot about eye glasses and the FM2N or the F3HP. It sounded grim. But I seem to do just fine on the FM2. Maybe thin glasses?]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[That FM2N is really good in the hands, can't wait for the 50mm to show up in the mail sometime in the next week or so. Hmmmm]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@ozalba @MikeIsaac one can only hope]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@jonduenas Makes sense, wish it was linear still...]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@jonduenas whatever those times are.... I usually just post when I'm home again in the early evening]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@jonduenas hmmmm makes sense. So I'm assuming most people who pay attention are posting same as before then]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@roycastro94 probably shoot a lot of colour -  but the black and white is beautiful too. Also the yellow film (or red) looks cool]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@roycastro94 I'm going to order a variety and see what I like. I haven't shot it in over a year - so I need to freshen up]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@roycastro94 focused fine even in my dark room with a lamp on. Hand, table, wall, whatever it just focused so quick haha]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@roycastro94 not yet :)]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[The focus system is crazy good! Even in the dark (it uses sound to focus).]]></document>
