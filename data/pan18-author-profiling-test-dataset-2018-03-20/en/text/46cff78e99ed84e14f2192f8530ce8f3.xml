		<document><![CDATA[@gavinugh it's not. But the non white westerners are still substantially more oppressed than the white ones and that also can't be denied]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@gavinugh however, said principles are still derived from white colonialism &amp; inherently racist/oppressive values that = detrimental to POCs]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@gavinugh in your opinion*. In mine, it derives from systematic principles of oppression that exist in EVERY culture. Ex- eastern shadeism]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@gavinugh your redundancy is underwhelming and yes, now I'm being condescending. PLZ leave this alone, you're backing yourself into a corner]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@gavinugh we are going around in circles. I have already addressed all of this. See my previous tweets. Goodnight]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@EyeRaaah I just honestly can't 🙄🙈]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@gavinugh When you ran out of arguments, you made false assumptions, claimed condescension and attacked me with immature profanity]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@gavinugh absolutely not. You had the opportunity to speak freely and you did. I disagreed with most of your statements and challenged them]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@gavinugh is your race not a factual component of your identity? I stated what your race was - there was no attack on it.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@gavinugh for the millionth time, I never said you deny it's existence. I apologized for the assumption and NEVER ATTACKED YOU]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@gavinugh the point of it is to STIMULATE conversation. In order to abolish racism, we must ADDRESS ITS EXISTENCE- It's working right?]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@gavinugh you had every opportunity to represent yourself so it's at the reader's discretion. Let's leave it to them.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@gavinugh you did the exact same thing to me - it was assumption after assumption. How are we even still arguing?!]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[I appreciate that. We can agree to disagree and I hope that you and @thelipscombe can converse about this again. :) https://t.co/pAF1POPzFO]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@jdrewix we can skype and you're welcome to record or post the session?]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@gavinugh to each their own. Again, my tweet asked that people NOT attack you but rather read our interaction - the public can weigh in.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@jdrewix anyways - I tried to have a civil convo with you about this. No need to attack my statements-we could talk in person if you prefer?]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@jdrewix that wasn't weak or hasty. That's me standing in my truth-for you to throw around even a hypothetical false rape situation is wrong]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@jdrewix also - I am a sexual assault survivor so maybe be wary when promoting victim mentality.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@jdrewix again, you believe it was staged. If it was, it would be AWFUL. Luckily that's not what we do. #MakeItAwkward]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[Twitter is really killing me today 🙄]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@jdrewix bring your problem to the @thelipscombe personally - don't knock our cause.]]></document>

		<document><![CDATA[@jdrewix there is no corporate entity - and all profits go towards various charitable causes like the Centre for Race &amp; Culture]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@jdrewix to each their own but I'll personally testify that this wasn't staged. I encourage you to find a better platform for anti-racism!]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@jdrewix the entire initiative is privately funded by him -have you looked into how much $ or awareness we've raised for causes w 0 profit?]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@jdrewix I'm the social Media Director for #MakeItAwkward and I wouldn't be involved with a cause that didn't serve a selfless purpose!]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@jdrewix unsure if his existence centres around marketing it when he is busy with film/music/fitness in addition to #MakeItAwkward ...?]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@jdrewix what's wrong with using your network to bring attention to a very important cause following an incident of oppression?]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@jdrewix since long before the incident which has brought much-needed attention to racism/bigotry. Still unsure what sources your skepticism]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@jdrewix I've had very similar encounters happen to me and Jesse has actually been a well-known staple in the arts/fitness scene in #YEG]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@gavinugh but you put this on a public forum where any of your keywords could've been searched and discovered. It was no attempt to "expose"]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@jdrewix interesting... what makes you say that?]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[Definitely! But drawing awareness to it to prevent future hate crimes once he's in custody is also important, right… https://t.co/aZhJljDc8L]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@gavinugh now you're being petty &amp; immature so this is where I make my exit. Every1 can read this interaction &amp; formulate their own opinion]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@gavinugh lol all you had to say was "I am involved". Reading back, you HAVE been extremely condescending. It's subjective after all.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@gavinugh anyways, I hope you have a good day. Off I go to work. Followers - what are your thoughts? NO ATTACKS on @gavinugh PLZ.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@gavinugh and I stand firmly behind the way in which I do it. If you feel the same way, get involved with a local initiative and speak up.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@gavinugh i have. I've been a social justice advocate for 10 years. I stand behind my mission to draw awareness to racism. #MakeItAwkward]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@gavinugh acknowledge that you have to read?! Sorry, that deserves no medal. When it comes to oppression, i have no desire to be concise]]></document>
