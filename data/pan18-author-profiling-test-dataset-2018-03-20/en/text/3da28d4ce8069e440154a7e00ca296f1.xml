As an adult I read them to remember what happened last time I played.]]></document>

		<document><![CDATA[@rhipratchett @KarthikKakarala Well, that settles that. :)

I look forward to whatever you’re working on next.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@SageTerrence Seriously, Goku needs magic wish balls just to be a threat. Can you imagine if Superman levelled up like that?]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@KarthikKakarala Also, the score for Rise of the Tomb Raider is amazing. Only reason I’m considering trying to 100% the game.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@KarthikKakarala I’m still sad she’s not on the movie. I know they’re working from her Laura mould, but I’d have loved that.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@KarthikKakarala If not, I’ll just follow her to her next game. One of the best game writers out there by far.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@KarthikKakarala Her website says she’s on another Square Enix project and she RT’d a coworker announcing the game. Not definite but maybe?]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@KarthikKakarala There’s a reasonable chance she’s writing the Avengers game though. Which would be amazing.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@KarthikKakarala 14 months later, finally finished Rise of the Tomb Raider. Probably the last one I’ll play: https://t.co/OHiuKWc8CS]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@KarthikKakarala @punkrocksellout @AvantGarve @mr_oberts It was a good pick.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@AskStraightTalk 34 days to respond? Wow.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@MidnighterBae Because they’re less conventional, energetic and use body language?]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@DanielElkin Be nice to Walruses. ❤]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@MJFeuerborn @punkrocksellout Even if it doesn't now, it will eventually.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@MJFeuerborn @punkrocksellout My suggestion? This couch. https://t.co/jrcaa9mXlX]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@MJFeuerborn @punkrocksellout Living Spaces, Target... where's the local pride?]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@MJFeuerborn @punkrocksellout Quite frankly I'm uncomfortable with Ben buying these mainstream couches anyway.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@punkrocksellout Apparently it was on sale a while back, but they sold all the clearance models. Too bad.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@punkrocksellout Find yourself a cheaper firm option then.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@punkrocksellout Now that's a good choice.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@punkrocksellout I'm in favour of a loveseat, but one with firmer cushions people don't sink into.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@punkrocksellout I do not like that feeling in offices. I want to feel composed and in control, and that chair takes that away for me.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@punkrocksellout It looks too comfy which means I'd feel uncomfortable while waiting in it. Love it in a home though.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@alsoMike @soveryadam Unfortunately it's ABC Signature Studios and not ABC Studios. That might kill the possibility.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@soveryadam @alsoMike Still could. Who's producing it?]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@DevonESawa Of course they shouldn't take it seriously.

It shouldn't be a sequel, it would need to be a Casper Cinematic Shared Universe!]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@AndrewWK Aren't all socks PARTY SOCKS though?]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@nielsvaneekelen @thewrongkeys I think the bigger risk is waiting for them to be burnt out, and then giving them an event.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@nielsvaneekelen @thewrongkeys They gave Hopeless Greg Land to boost Spider-Woman. They like their internal narratives.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@nielsvaneekelen @thewrongkeys Which this is.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@thewrongkeys @nielsvaneekelen Okay, but given that Marvel will put out events anyway...]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@thewrongkeys @nielsvaneekelen Come on. You're telling me after Ultimates, you don't want to see him on an event?]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@thewrongkeys @nielsvaneekelen Not a great book for him to be on, but it'll sell well, and hopefully justify him getting a big event.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@TVGrimReaper Maybe next season you can have a random card generator, so you can have more options. William Shatner deserves a spot now too.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@TVGrimReaper I think the Twitter spot needs to be updated with Nielsen's Social Content Ratings.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@NickinDallas @punkrocksellout @KarthikKakarala @AvantGarve @mr_oberts So far I've done Smash Mouth and Moana. Likely 3-4 more songs to go.]]></document>

		<document><![CDATA[@thewrongkeys No seriously, I bought the digital TPBs and the digital singles. That's a bit of a mistake on my part.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@thewrongkeys Oh, apparently I bought it in digital twice. Heh.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@thewrongkeys I think I've owned it three times. Monthly, digests and digital.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@dog_rates Must be a bug in the @AppStore. It wouldn’t let me give it higher than a 5 out of 5. https://t.co/A1ng37FQXJ]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@KarthikKakarala @AvantGarve @punkrocksellout @mr_oberts So, two songs done so far. Do I need a third one today? It's snowing here again.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@dog_rates I still want WeRateDogs stickers for iMessage.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@TVGrimReaper Oh come on, we both know you're cheering for the (0,0) just to actually see it. I know I am.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@TVGrimReaper In your chase for the elusive (0.0), have you became an anti-fan yourself? 😂]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@sinisterjhk Dangerous refugee children, bad hombres and paid protestors are America’s greatest weakness.]]></document>

		<document><![CDATA[@unlikelynerd Why do they give me non-bow weapons in Tomb Raider? I feel like they think I’ll ever use them.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@unlikelynerd Quite the reward for getting rid of Milo.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@KarthikKakarala Her top rated movie there, she’s killed in the opening scene.]]></document>

		<document><![CDATA[@thewrongkeys @KarimShehimi Isn’t that an Inhuman power?]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@thewrongkeys @KarimShehimi Maybe her name is Power Princess because she's Inhuman Royalty!]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@thewrongkeys @KarimShehimi  I wonder how the comics will retcon Molly into being an Inhuman...?]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@thewrongkeys @KarimShehimi Maybe they'll just pull the same shtick with Inhumans?]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@thewrongkeys @KarimShehimi Will it? Other than her parents being enhanced, what will the major difference there be?]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@thewrongkeys @KarimShehimi The actress playing playing Molly is 14. That's not far off from 12.]]></document>

		<document><![CDATA[@Leask I play games so slowly that I still have Wii U games to play. But I’ll play Zelda on Wii U.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@Leask I’m out for the Switch though. Got a Wii U and not enough new in 2017 to justify upgrading.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@Leask Heh. We skipped the hot springs ourselves too. Boating is definitely a factor. Though lots of boat time as we stayed at Lone Cone.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@Leask Why can’t you make it?]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@Snarkosa Right, and I disagree with that. I think outright opposition is better. But that's not the same as 'give him a chance'.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@Snarkosa He's saying that the only option he sees is to work with Trump rather than against him. I disagree with him, but that's different.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@Snarkosa I'm not saying he's the hero here, but he's not saying to embrace Trump, nor to give Trump a chance.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@Snarkosa I don't think he made that conclusion though. The article doesn't pull that from a direct quote.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@Snarkosa It's a pretty big mischaracterization of what he actually said.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@TVGrimReaper Your former site is embarrassing. Claiming the producer makes a renewal more likely. No wonder I don'… https://t.co/fl8eq2VIMy]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@thordiakow I fully expect to see a clip of GroundThor Day any moment now.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@DennysCanada Okay, but I'm way more likely to go to Denny's if you reject people like that. I'll go tonight and take his place.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@juice005 @KarthikKakarala @mr_oberts @punkrocksellout I could probably do a song called that... I mean, I don't know why but...]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@KarthikKakarala @juice005 @mr_oberts @punkrocksellout Might have been Shiny. Either worked.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@KarthikKakarala @juice005 @mr_oberts @punkrocksellout Pick a song.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@KarthikKakarala @juice005 @mr_oberts @punkrocksellout Normally I just sing Moana.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@KarthikKakarala @SageTerrence Also why we need a Black lead.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@KarthikKakarala @SageTerrence Plus, he’s too good for Oliver. It’s the Arrow handicap. Can’t be better than the leader.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@KarthikKakarala @punkrocksellout @AvantGarve @mr_oberts It’s the poop that concerned me. Okay, next song soon.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@KarthikKakarala @punkrocksellout @AvantGarve @mr_oberts In this case I meant juggling more than quality. Holding 2 leashes and a poop bag.]]></document>

Okay, I’m out.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@RobertRambles I’m surprised nobody is calling the electoral college the alt-popular vote yet.]]></document>

		<document><![CDATA[@lepineisme Someone just got a copy of CW II #0, Captain Marvel #1 and Wolverine #66.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@lepineisme Already redeemed, but isn't that under the new digital copy program? Doesn't give copies of the book it's from anymore.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@thewrongkeys Well, I'll let you know how I feel about him in 6 months then?]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@thewrongkeys If anyone is going to ape Stranger Things, it should be Hopeless writing a Runaways book with those themes.]]></document>

		<document><![CDATA[@scottberry @VaGentlenerd @mr_oberts Which makes me glad we live in an era of leaks.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@VaGentlenerd @mr_oberts @scottberry At this point, there really need to be photos posted. You agree with that, right?]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@Like_car_Keys @jpooch21 Right, but it's enough to demonstrate Nintendo isn't the company to buy for gaming strategies.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@jpooch21 @Like_car_Keys Definitely. I just don't see Disney as the right partner here, and think the IP is less valuable that most think.]]></document>
