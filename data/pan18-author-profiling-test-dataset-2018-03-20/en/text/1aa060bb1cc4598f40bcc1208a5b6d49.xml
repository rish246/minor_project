		<document><![CDATA[@CraigPeebles Yeah, I'm really shocked at how quickly he's launched into the messed up executive orders.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@CraigPeebles Fair enough, I think it's just really hard to talk about right now because everyone is so frightened about what's going on.]]></document>
