		<document><![CDATA[So here's the question: do sanctions no longer apply when a Russian entity is taking an action to comply with a request from the FSB?]]></document>

		<document><![CDATA[If "Note to Para (a)(1)" doesn't apply to (a)(2) or (a)(3), the license authorizes those transactions -- even if to, or on behalf of, FSB.]]></document>

		<document><![CDATA[Where I have concern is the drafting of the note to (a)(1), which provides that this does *not* permit activities that benefit FSB itself.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[So General License 1 fixes this by authorizing payment of license processing fees, etc., to the FSB. That's all cool.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[Fee isn't much (~$50), but goes to FSB bank account. Earlier sanctions made payment of this fee illegal, even where export was permitted.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[FSB licenses some software (i.e. encryption, and the iPhones it comes in) which requires a modest administrative fee https://t.co/R9EtM6sj3T]]></document>

		<document><![CDATA[But this isn't an area where you want drafting errors, and to me it is unclear how parts of the general license were intended to operate.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[DISCLAIMER: to be very clear, what I'm suggesting here is a possible drafting error in Gen Lic 1's wording, not something done by design.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[No, that OFAC general license didn't remove sanctions from FSB as was reported--but it does have some ambiguous language worth considering.]]></document>
