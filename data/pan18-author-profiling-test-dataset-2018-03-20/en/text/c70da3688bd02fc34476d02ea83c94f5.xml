		<document><![CDATA[@Aezreal The 1 hr wait was in the morning. It took like 2 hours longer to get home because the driver drove very slow. Understandable tho...]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@Aezreal Yeah I was in a very bad mood on Friday because I had to wait for an hour in the cold for the bus. I got home at 9 PM too :/]]></document>

		<document><![CDATA[@Aezreal Yes, I was wearing boots and snow still got in them LOL. It can get worse. There's been so many traffic accidents :(]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[The 15 or so cm of snow makes me want to stay at home FOREVER... or until winter is over. Hibernation has never been so tempting haha]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@Aezreal Haha yeah it's because I kept referring my friends by the first letter of their name, so A, C, etc.]]></document>

		<document><![CDATA[@sindyblue10 Lol I just noticed the diamond beside your name. I don't think it's general knowledge...]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@aine751 Oh I thought you were a girl lol. It's okay, either is fine! ^^]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@Matt_n_th_Hat No need to say sorry. I blame the snow for causing traffic accidents. Maybe it's better that it doesn't snow in your area...]]></document>

		<document><![CDATA[@Aezreal Yes, I think so too. Thank you :)]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@Matt_n_th_Hat I think the worst part was going through it alone. Maybe because I never talked about it. Haha]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@Matt_n_th_Hat Thanks, it is something that happened a while ago. I've healed, but I guess it's something I will always remember.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@RemyFool Thank you. I've never talked about this at all before. I just didn't blog much that time. I'm glad I finally said something.]]></document>

		<document><![CDATA[@Matt_n_th_Hat It's not a bad habit. I apologize a lot too. Yeah, it's a way to make friends, I agree.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@Matt_n_th_Hat Ahaha no need to keep on apologizing! It's really okay! Yeah, it is a great thing for sure that anime reaches out to all]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@Matt_n_th_Hat No worries! I wasn't trying to call you out. I know that you're not that kind of person. DW]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@Matt_n_th_Hat Hmm why must there be proof? The wording is a little... awkward. It sounds as if it's surprising that pretty women like anime]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@PalpableEmoji Yeah :/ If they do scale it, it will be 88% which is a good score, but sad to know that my actual score was a lot higher]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@PalpableEmoji It's literally so sad. Last term, my final grade got scaled down 7%. I almost cried LOL. Thanks!! ^^]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[68/70 on my first exam this term. 97.14% ehehe. The Uni will scale my mark down though because it's "too high." T.T]]></document>

		<document><![CDATA[@animated06 Oh yeah. I never realized either. It just seemed so normal]]></document>
