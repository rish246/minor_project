		<document><![CDATA[@ezy06001 if he were genuine he wouldn't answer with 'I'm traditional' and avoid further discussion, sometimes lack of comment says more]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@ezy06001 no...not media messages, exactly what I've observed of trump in interviews. What he says and what questions he avoids]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@ezy06001 you know that presumably or you wouldn't have all those opinions about Hilary]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@ezy06001 If you need a direct explicit quote as proof of someones intentions then you're kinda screwed.]]></document>

		<document><![CDATA[@ezy06001 nobody wants racist politicians? That's a lie. Racists want racist politicians. There's plenty of openly racist people around]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@ezy06001 @JOMainEvent I've said like 3 times this conversation is not about Hilary]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@ezy06001 I don't know how relevant that is tbh, the fact that his win has white nationalists rejoicing, racism on the increase is telling]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@ezy06001 @JOMainEvent that doesn't mean jack shit. Thats like saying 'im not racist I have black friends' yawn]]></document>
