		<document><![CDATA[@JonoNewton @MetService Sounds like a misunderstanding of the Tararua ranges warning? https://t.co/6zYiyId6s7]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@ChrisRMcDonald Ha that would seem to fit the theme wouldn't it.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@ChrisRMcDonald this is amazing! I'm assuming you're already onto a mock up? ;)]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@yomcat @JayHarvie Will be nice to see some of the teams that don't normally make that effort to start being at the clubrooms.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@yomcat @JayHarvie Yep field pressure made that worse tho e.g Elite played a "home" game at Wilton, but we come back regardless.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@yomcat @JayHarvie I can imagine. It's been tough losing that and also losing Newtown 1 for most of season with the U20 WC too!]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@yomcat @JayHarvie Seatoun and UH could have social men's playing curtain raiser for the WCL?]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@JayHarvie Yeah it's 100% a great change for you and many others in your situation.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@JayHarvie Newtown in particular might be good though with the number 2 in theory available for teams to play at home again.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@JayHarvie Us social league battlers are often at curtain raiser times too. You'll pick up some spectators but lose others I guess?]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@JayHarvie Overall probably a great move but might mean a further drop in spectators with people playing  e.g. me]]></document>

		<document><![CDATA[@JayHarvie @Tegal1234 @patrick478 Just to be clear though I think it can be done well but often isn't. e.g. Panhead is still great for now.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@JayHarvie @Tegal1234 @patrick478 Remember mac's and monteith's....]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@ShaneHarmon Where do I send the bribe to upgrade my platinum seats to backstage? ;)]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@pineyzb @patrick478 @Dale_Warburton This. Not obeying the terms of any ban should simply result in further and harsher sanction.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@Dale_Warburton @patrick478 Completely agree. I couldn't see anything about that in my quick skim though. All seems to be physical locations]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@Dale_Warburton @patrick478 I'd think so. But it could be really poor wording choice that was *meant* to mean just the area of play.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@Dale_Warburton @patrick478 Comp rules state they supersede that but what exactly does 'playing arena' mean in 5.13 https://t.co/89wZJ4KFEY]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@Dale_Warburton @patrick478 He's talking about 12.2 from here which then refers to 13.1 but thats not the comp rules https://t.co/4oLj9K8QDY]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@patrick478 @Ryans_Rovers Our main two are yellow and black sure but white is certainly one of our long standing brand colours. Kits too.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@patrick478 @Ryans_Rovers That's probably why they use it as the accent colour on the website too. Def one of their brand colours.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@Dale_Warburton Hmm perhaps we should rethink this bus to New Plymouth?]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@ChrisRMcDonald @The_Nighthawks @Dale_Warburton @patrick478 Then again perhaps Dale means on the website?]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@Dale_Warburton @patrick478 @ChrisRMcDonald What? I like the latest version on the hoodies? Don't mess with it plz.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@Tegal1234 nah we all good. Where are you watching from?]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@Tegal1234 I'd say so based on the staff.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@Tegal1234 yeah upstairs closed due to someone in strife up there?]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@IamNotJonahHill @Tegal1234 Do we think the 'after' photo is down to a filter  or a rocking buzz?]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@Coleadve @vaughndavis Ha seems we are on the same google journey at the same time.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@vaughndavis @Coleadve Best guess says maybe Gemstar but looks like lots of different regional names - https://t.co/EVJuktfTnb]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@NZPhotomac @patrick478 Disagree - he clearly kicks it into the post.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@Ryans_Rovers Oh wow so a three way tie on 3 wins. I'll have to make it back into prem this time so I don't fall too far behind!]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@JayHarvie We've prepared a standard Wellington landing for you. Enjoy!]]></document>

		<document><![CDATA[@Ryans_Rovers Ta doing now. Random q - do your records show who has the most Prem championships?]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@patrick478 Basically I think 1.5 would be pretty decent outcome for Oceania. Two only makes sense if Aussie move back.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@patrick478 Obviously with more auto spots the quality of playoff opp would drop but still good for the islands I'd say.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@patrick478 They'd also get to host a game though? I'd think the exposure to a decent opp would be good. Similar to us now.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@Yorrike Exactly. I remember upgrading from a 250 mb to a gig and thinking that was so much how would I ever fill it.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@Yorrike It's crazy these days deleting single files that are many times larger than the first hard drives I owned.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[People probably need to actually read the Altaba story rather than just the headline huh? It's only the part that owns Alibaba shares....]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@Ryans_Rovers @JP_BNE Of course it was the week you play me as well...]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@Tegal1234 @patrick478 The actual temp isn't different but some conditions are better/worse conductors of that temp to your skin.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@Tegal1234 @patrick478 I think it's easiest to think of it as how easily the heat transfers to your skin. Diff conditions change that.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@patrick478 the assistant clearly saw it. It's literally in front of him]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[Surely even @TheRealBozza can agree the referees are bringing nothing to the league with shit like that.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[A yellow for a headbutt? You're kidding right?]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@patrick478 probably depends what it goes down as for? Dangerous play I guess?]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[Only 5.5? That doesn't seem right #eqnz]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[Well that'll keep you on your toes huh #eqnz]]></document>

		<document><![CDATA[@NZPhotomac @Yakcall @sthnjeff Are we engaging with him on this?! I used to have a soap addiction. It was a dirty habit but I'm clean now.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@Tegal1234 Once Trump quotes from an article is that quote now a verifiable source and open to publishing as real news?]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@Tegal1234 Yup - and equally one fake news source being used as proof by "fact checkers" for another fake news article.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[Good change to see but with so many sources publishing this stuff now we might already be too far gone.… https://t.co/DKBrua3JQI]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@Yakcall Ha you made the mistake of posting?]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@Yakcall @cosmo_nz What was the discussion like around the lack of that quake? Did the lizard people change plan cos they'd been exposed?]]></document>

		<document><![CDATA[@patrick478 It's been clear for some time now that @FFA don't really understand how to engage their stakeholders - or even know who they are]]></document>

		<document><![CDATA[I reckon they probably need a couple more flags #ESvAC https://t.co/NpcrufDEA8]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@ACFCsupporters @GforGegenPress @roryosffx @coolian2 @tintin25 @official_lesdog @saulov8 @OfficialSpursNZ I'll make it about 12ish.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@Tegal1234 @Dale_Warburton Yep. Which sadly is probably why you need a few trials where it doesn't work to realise it didn't work.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@Dale_Warburton Completely agree. I don't understand complete opposition to it. There will be some elements that work great and improve game]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@Dale_Warburton The only way to find that balance is to have a few times where it clearly doesn't work and realise "that was too much"]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@Dale_Warburton I remain convinced you can bring in elements that work. Eg goal line tech. But have to strike the right balance.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@Dale_Warburton That will end well...]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@nzsecretsanta Hey team - where do I update the email you have for me? Looks like it' probably using the one from when I signed up in 2013!]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@WestpacStadium Ah yup. Cool! Was it a stabilised turf last time too then?]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@WestpacStadium All natural? Or is it hybrid this time around?]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@Tegal1234 @Nakiman You also can't send credit cards but that's how mine have always arrived. I think it's a don't ask don't tell.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@Tegal1234 @Nakiman @nzpost I'd guess it makes stealing the post a target? Same as jewelry etc. Your risk sure but also the postie's safety]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@Tegal1234 @Nakiman @nzpost Pretty sure that sending cash and vouchers has long been banned. Don't think that's anything new.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@ByPhillipRollo @patrick478 Results maybe. But clubs financial stability is their own issue. Tickets sales go to clubs not FFA.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@patrick478 Not to mention the 5200 for CCM in an actual home game only two rounds ago]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@patrick478 Well it is a pretty poor figure but isn't it the FFA pushing for the games out of Wellington anyway...?]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@patrick478 Ugh. Who has been bringing it up today?]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@CarlyW226 I think you can safely assume that's not true.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@Ryans_Rovers Yeah. Pretty sure it'll be a new one now.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@Ryans_Rovers I think if it's within 2 years you get to renew. After that it's new.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@sthnjeff @patrick478 @ACFCsupporters I don't think I'll cut it that fine luckily. 90 mins to make it what looks to be a 25 minute drive.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@sthnjeff @patrick478 @ACFCsupporters Yeah. I'd only risk that if there was lots of scope for delay and still making it. $50 uber tho.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@patrick478 @ACFCsupporters Could always split fare an uber if there are two of us.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@ACFCsupporters My rough glance makes it look plausible to make a 5:30 flight so I might be keen.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@ACFCsupporters What are travel options/times like from there to airport?]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@AdamRyan @Ryans_Rovers Ugh. I've been a dire run since this season began.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@Ryans_Rovers True but with a quote about how Victory are "doing it the hard way" it still feels a bit rich. Many clubs have same or worse.]]></document>
