		<document><![CDATA[@goonerdave66 @GoonerGirl1969 Used to turn Gooners against their own manager and club. And so many are over this story.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@goonerdave66 @GoonerGirl1969 Not meaning to say you are foolish Dave. Just that I feel it is a negative over reaction abt nothing.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@goonerdave66 @GoonerGirl1969 Perhaps he could have dodged the question. Would that make a difference? Media just playing our fans as fools.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@GoonerGirl1969 @goonerdave66 ridiculous to blame Wenger for this. Was asked by journo 'kante did you ever look to sign him?']]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@Fattcheeked I see. Yes I guess there wasn't so much controversy here over Barry's Eos! Amazing years to get obamacare and Iran deal wasted!]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[It seemed top level sport was being driven further and further to dominance of youth. Lately seems to be a resurgence of the older athlete!]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@Fattcheeked so why couldn't Obama sign executive orders like this? Over what I consider good things?!]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@Fattcheeked I understand that some ppl view what he is doing as positive. But how are those changes coming so quickly?]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[Isn't it astonishing how it took @BarackObama years to make progress but it is taking Trump days to undo all the good work?!]]></document>

		<document><![CDATA[Headline: 'Wenger gives Arsenal flops an absolutely normal recovery program followed by any top level football team'

Not clickbaity enough?]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[It is so hard going from @BarackObama perhaps the greatest orator in the world today to Donald Trump.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@N5_1BU Wow really?! That is pretty deep! I only remember them from the great sides they had in late 90s early 00s!]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@Goonermatt1886 Exactly and when Alexis was first put up top 'He is never a striker, we can't play him there' lol round and round we go!]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@N5_1BU Ah I see! Wondered how you could have been keen on him so early! I had only seen him once or twice before. Lovely player!]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@N5_1BU I don't mind him starting. He has done well whenever he plays. But was injured for a stretch and only recently coming back in!]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@N5_1BU For me it is a way of being negative about player Y. Can't we just support the team? Whoever is playing?]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@Goonermatt1886 I've seen so many who complain incessantly abt Ox when he does play saying 'what has he got to do to get a start'!]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[Still a common trend with Arsenal fans to really really want player X playing over whoever is actually picked. Latest love is Lucas.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@Fattcheeked There was one point Kaboul had both his arms in a lock holding him. Fk was given to Kaboul!]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@Fattcheeked That was madness. Never a foul. And then Kaboul is kicking lumps out of Giroud with not even a hint of a Fk being given!]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@RyanTomes Like when Ozil was fouled and ball broke to Deeney. Waited 5 secs before blowing. Then said he was playing advantage! To WHO?]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@Fattcheeked Not only shit it was completely and obviously biased. So many fouls not called for us whereas any contact on Watford was a FK.]]></document>

		<document><![CDATA[@Stillberto @arseblog With the way Jose behaves I am not sure even this would embarrass him. Surprised the Sunday Times stand for it though.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@arseblog @Stillberto Have you ever seen a journalist so clearly become a part of a manager's PR team? It is really really Bizarre.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@jackthegooner1 Haha too true. Though the headlines don't really match what was said to be fair to the Trumpster.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@Welsh_Gooner haha! You know you will still go!! We are suckers for this club whatever they do to us!]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@teaandabikkie Yes there were definitely complaints.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@teaandabikkie somehow disagrees with you.]]></document>

		<document><![CDATA[People you face far greater danger to you and your loved ones health from the loss of the NHS to privatisation than from ISIS. Believe that.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@teaandabikkie that in the Metro unfortunately. You should ask yourself why. And if you don't then you are in denial.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@teaandabikkie I believe there is a danger. But for you personally the loss of the NHS is far greater danger than ISIS. But you won't read..]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@teaandabikkie 'Louis says ISIS would have no hesitation to destroy mankind with an overdose of Custard Creams' and that warrants a ban?]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@teaandabikkie Not one of these articles provides any evidence of what you claim to have intelligence of? I cld claim something myself!]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@teaandabikkie I don't believe in them. I am sure whatever intelligence is released to the public is done not for protective purposes.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@teaandabikkie but somehow you believe in a country where more ppl have been killed by toddlers than terrorists that this is warranted!]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@Dav1dOLeary The ban composes only Muslim majority countries and excludes those of minority religions from those countries.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@teaandabikkie What do you base this upon? Can I have evidence of the intelligence reports you have access to?]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@teaandabikkie It has zero to do with intelligence reports and lots to do with provoking a reaction.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@teaandabikkie Trump himself does not believe this ban enhances the safety of Americans. His only aim is to please supporters.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@Dav1dOLeary Donald Trump had a different view on this to you: https://t.co/nOeyzySPEZ]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@teaandabikkie Do you think this ban is an effective measure of weeding them out?]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@teaandabikkie I wonder if the intelligence agencies have looked at the perpetrators of terrorist acts in the last 10 years and origin?]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[What difference does it make if the #MuslimBan excludes Uk Citizens?! Are we more important than other humans? Because of our passport?]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[May invites a fascist racist for a state visit against the wishes of many ppl. 'He leads a protest I lead a country' Irrelevant no?!!]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[May Lied on Trident misfire her response? 'I want to defend this country, Corbyn does not' Irrelevant no!?]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[It seems the media haven't tired of May using insults to Corbyn as her get out clause for her many faults. I wonder if the public are?]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@jackthegooner1 What you wld find is other FANS don't agree. Their managers and team mates wld take Ozil 100% of the time.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@jackthegooner1 I know you are not his biggest fan but he is too good for compeitition. Wld walk in to any team in the prem as a starter.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@jackthegooner1 I think the problem is his best position is as a 10. But he will never play there ahead of Ozil for us. not suited to being8]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@jackthegooner1 He didn't play well which was a factor. I Wonder how far into the game he started feeling his calf injury.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@davearmstrong8 Not easy to be composed as an Arsenal fan for sure! Well a win on sat and we can dream again.......]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@davearmstrong8 Yep but that stops any sensible analysis of our games or results.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@awosss But that makes my point even stronger. You could get a new top manager (Klopp) and still lose games in the same way.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@davearmstrong8 Too true. Some of the Outs have built up animosity through familiarity with Wenger's faults over the 20 years.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[Take for eg LFC losing last 2 home games before CFC. It wld be silly for LFC fans to think sacking Klopp gives them 2 wins in those games.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[The outs would say replace Wenger and we win last night. That is very very far from certain. And actually on probability less likely.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[The problem with the Wenger in/out thing is that for many all our problems are binary like that. In truth top level sport far more complex.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@jackthegooner1 I think it is a bit easy to blame 'mentality' it looks that way as fans but there is more to it than that.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@jackthegooner1 Silvinho and Winterburn hardly ever scored but occasionally those go in. Have to try. Alexis always does that.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@jackthegooner1 We probably needed a goal in the first half. Monreal volley wasn't wrong thing. Gab attacking so much was odd though.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@jackthegooner1 Just crazy to think we would make that same mistake so many times. Even if we kept it 1-0 was ok. 2nd goal was a joke.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@fkhanage @AngryOfN5 @goonerdave66 it is strange how rarely we start first half how we started the second. Why can't we do that?]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[It looks simple. You say if we started the first half of these games with the intensity we started the second we would win comfortably.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[Ox on the other hand was fantastic again tonight. Excellent performance. Maybe the middle of the park really is his thing.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[Gab: poor throw+no recovery run
Ramsey: not ready for throw+no recovery run 
Coq: beaten too easily
Mustafi: beaten too easily]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[First goal could be a little unlucky with the deflection. Just don't concede a second. Looking at amount of players at fault for 2nd is nuts]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[The hardest thing about tonight is it comes again just after you start to build up hope for this team. They then let you down. Ungently.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[Seeing ppl defending America's #MuslimBan with the issue that some Muslim countries ban Israelis. Since when did two wrongs make a right?!]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@jackthegooner1 Are you suggesting that everyone was completely aware of just how bad Hitler wld turn out to be from 1933?]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA["Those ppl who say they wld have stood up to the Nazi's, believe me they wld not have done" 
Fascinating subject an… https://t.co/BbXc2i8npf]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@jackthegooner1 I thought you knew everything about Nazi Germany? This is quite well documented. Being there helps but I can read also.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@jackthegooner1 I am sure you have seen the stats on Americans killed by Islamic terrorism and also the ban countries vs business interests?]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@jackthegooner1 I am certain. Absolutely certain many people felt that way about Hitler in 1933. And said the same thing.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@jackthegooner1 do you know in 30s Britain there were some who supported Hitler and felt we sld side with him? Including politicians.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@jackthegooner1 are ignoring is the process of history. Which was my point. Hitler didn't start off killing Jews and invading places.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@jackthegooner1 what you are saying, as many do, is that Trump is not as bad as Hitler RIGHT NOW so bowing down to him is ok. But what you..]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@jackthegooner1 remember when Hitler was elected he could also conceivably be voted out. Yes he formed a 'union' with Austria. That ok then?]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@jackthegooner1 do you think Hitler started off invading countries? He won power in 33. Invaded Austria in 38.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[It is obvious that If May was PM in the 30s she would have been inviting Hitler over and pushing the economic benefits of ties with Germany.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@anazrof astonishing the difference in reaction between them. She is hopeless.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[Considering the Brexit vote I would love to see a poll of how many Brits who agree with Trump's #MuslimBan could be a frightening result.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[Why should we be surprised the Tories are so willing to jump on board with Trump? There is a long line of previous here.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@Fattcheeked @DuncanCastles it is a bit mental though isn't it? I've never seen a journo simply become a manager's PR like this!]]></document>
