		<document><![CDATA[@aimsbtw Trump wanted his land at any price (and tried to make Michael's 90-yr-old mother homeless by compulsory purchase).]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@aidanskinner It's never been tested, obviously, but there's been voices in both sides. Would require another quick court case maybe.]]></document>

		<document><![CDATA[@blacktaako yup: and yet I still believe things would be even worse outside - the Brexit vote isn't delivering some Lexit dream]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@blacktaako oh dear - have you blocked me or should I pay up? I do think leaving the EU will make things even worse for non-EU migrants tho.]]></document>
